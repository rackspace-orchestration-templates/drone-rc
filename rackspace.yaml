instructions: |
  #### Welcome to Drone
  This will deploy a single Linux server running
  [Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone).

  #### Github Application Requirement
  In order to login to Drone, a Github Application is required. Read the [setup
  instructions](https://github.com/drone/drone#github) for details on this
  process. The Application ID and Secret have to be placed in the
  /etc/drone/drone.toml file.

  By default, this template will deploy as HTTPS instead of HTTP. Be sure to
  configure the appropriate Homepage and Callback URL using HTTPS. The use
  of DNS names is highly recommended.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Drone Configuration Options
  Drone's configuration is controlled using the /etc/drone/drone.toml
  file. If you do not provide your Github Application ID and Secret
  you will need to login to the server and update these options manually.
  After updating the configuration file, restart Drone.

  #### Web Interface
  There are many options you can configure in the web interface on your Drone
  instance. You will want to follow the [setup
  documentation](http://drone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup.html) to
  configure the basics.

  #### Drone Service
  Drone can be controlled using the standard 'start' and 'stop' service
  commands. You will need to restart drone if you modify the above
  configuration in /etc/default/drone.

  To restart Drone, issue these commands:
  stop drone
  start drone

  #### SSL Configuration
  This setup provides a self signed SSL certificate with the server's IP
  address as the Common Name. To provide a new certificate, simply overwrite
  the two files in /etc/drone/ssl/ with your signed certificates. Restart Drone
  to apply the new certificate.
